# Volatility-Forecasting-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This is the database for my personal Master's degree dissertation, in which I pretend to compare the forecasting capacity of multiple models, when it comes to forecasting the stock index volatility after 2 weeks of war in Ukraine.
the models to be use under this analysis are the following:
- GARCH (1,1)
- GARCH-MIDAS, including low frequency variables
- Support Vector Regression, including high freqeuncy variables
- LSTM
- Transformer

Once the paper is submited and available on a public repository i will added it here.
